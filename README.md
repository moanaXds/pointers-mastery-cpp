## ðŸŽ¯ Overview

This repository serves as a complete reference guide for understanding and mastering pointers in C++. It includes meticulously organized code examples, dry runs, and practical implementations that demonstrate various pointer concepts from fundamental to advanced levels.

## âœ¨ Features

- **Comprehensive Coverage**: From basic pointer arithmetic to complex multi-dimensional allocations
- **Practical Examples**: Real-world scenarios and dry runs
- **Memory Management**: Proper allocation and deallocation techniques
- **Advanced Concepts**: Function pointers, pointer arrays, and const correctness
- **Well-Documented**: Clear comments and explanations throughout

## ðŸ“– Topics Covered

### ðŸ”¹ Core Concepts
- Pointer declaration and initialization
- Pointer arithmetic and operations
- Address-of (&) and dereference (*) operators

### ðŸ”¹ Const Correctness
- Constant pointers vs pointers to constants
- `const int*` vs `int* const` vs `const int* const`
- Type casting with pointers

### ðŸ”¹ Memory Management
- Dynamic memory allocation (`new`/`delete`)
- Single and multi-dimensional arrays
- 1D, 2D, 3D, and 4D dynamic allocations
- Proper memory deallocation patterns

### ðŸ”¹ Advanced Pointers
- Pointer to pointers (`int**`, `int***`)
- Arrays of pointers vs pointer arrays
- Function pointers and callbacks
- Void pointers and type casting

### ðŸ”¹ String Handling
- Character pointers vs character arrays
- String manipulation with pointers
- Pointer arrays for strings

### ðŸ”¹ Multi-dimensional Arrays

- Pointer arithmetic with 2D/3D arrays
- Access patterns and memory layout
-----------------------------------

To get the most out of this repo, take out each code file separately, dry-run it step by step, and observe how pointers behave in memory. Modify values, add print statements, and experiment to solidify your understanding.
